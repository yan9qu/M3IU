# MINE: Multimodal IntentioN and Emotion Understanding in the Wild

During the review phase, we only released some of the raw data. Each folder is one sample.

Will be open sourced:
1. Scripts and instructions for all steps of dataset collection, cleaning, and feature pre-extraction.
2. High quality labels of emotion, intention; missing modality labels, and topic labels.
3. Corresponding benchmark.
