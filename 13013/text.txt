Avatar The way of water. 7.5/10.
Very gorgeous and the water parts of the movie were clear winners above the rest, I like the new clan of Na'vi. The story is overall alright, It felt like it both didn't need to be 3 hours long but also we got very little out of the antagonists. https://t.co/vRxMYhApce
