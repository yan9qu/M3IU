Running a company is hard. I learned so much as CEO of Ping this year.
Highlights:
- We joined Y Combinator’s W22 batch
- Some of the BIGGEST streams now use Ping (Linus Tech and Austin Show)
- Twitch cloned us lol

Oh, also: I hosted a 60k listener space about Twitch’s failures https://t.co/EgFnP4DPGA
